# wordChain
This is a very simple word game I have created for fun and education. Here you can start with any word of your choice and keep adding new word which starts with the last letter of the previous word. In background the code will checking the word in the dictionary for its validity. It makes sense to play this game only when you add new words out of your memory and not by taking help from dictionary.
